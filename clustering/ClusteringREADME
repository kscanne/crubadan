The "clustering" files provide functions in python useful for performing cluster 
analysis on large collections of documents.

                          --DocumentDataSet--
This is the primary computation file, it is used for performing k-means cluster
analysis of a given collection of documents, along with the more basic
intermediary functions such as dist and mean. In addition, the kAnalysis method
iterates over a range of k and performs clustering trials, then returning
a graph of k vs. the average distance from a cluster center/mean.

There are two classes here: dataProfile and profileDataSet. dataProfile
functions as the wrapper for individual documents, methods from this class can
compare documents as is useful. An instance of profileDataSet is composed of
instances of dataProfile; it is how we store a collection of documents. 
profileDataSet is the class that allows for clustering analysis.

Usage notes:

  The loadCurrentDir method is the easiest way to load a collection
  of files into their proper formats, especially if they are already arranged
  in their own directory. Just place this file in that directory, then 
  instantiate a profileDataSet and use loadCurrentDir via IDE or script.

  There are several vectorization protocols available as helper functions, but
  note that all additional vectorizations must be added also to the "vectorizefile" 
  function.
  
  The graphical plotting done in kAnalysis requires extra libraries not
  native to standard python interpreters, make sure these are available
  before attempting to use the file.

                          --AccuracyAnalysis--
This file may be useful for error checking on an analysis a set with a known
cluster assignment already available. In this form it will work for up to 
k = 9 with the proper format. For k > 9, some tweaks will be necessary.
